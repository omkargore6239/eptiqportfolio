The ERP system handles core business functions such as finance, HR, inventory, and procurement, while the OFS ensures real-time tracking of dispatches, notifications to clients, and order processing.

The integration between these systems enables seamless data flow across departments, reducing operational friction and enabling more informed decision-making. Real-time updates on orders, coupled with detailed reports from both systems, give managers and teams full visibility into the manufacturing and supply chain processes. This integration has not only enhanced productivity but also optimized the order fulfillment cycle, ensuring that products are delivered on time and to the highest standards.`,
